# alert rules are all stored in this part of the cluster:
# /etc/prometheus/rules/prometheus-monitoring-kube-prometheus-prometheus-rulefiles-0/*.yaml
# running this as a Prometheus Operator means the addition of alert rules will automatically be handled
# running Prometheus stack outside of K8s cluster means we would have to add this in manually and reload Prometheus

# for testing using a containerized cpu stress container, use the below (this is from dockerhub)
# kubectl run cpu-test --image=containerstack/cpustress -- --cpu 4 --timeout 30s --metrics-brief
